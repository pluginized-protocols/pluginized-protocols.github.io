Every year, the [Internet Research Task Force](https://irtf.org) awards the [Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP)](https://irtf.org/anrp/) to recognise the best recent results in applied networking, interesting new research ideas of potential relevance to the Internet standards community. In late 2020, 78 papers published in networking conferences and journals were nominated. The xBGP paper, [xBGP: When You Can’t Wait for the IETF and Vendors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3422604.3425952)
 written by Thomas Wirtgen (UCLouvain), Quentin De Coninck (UCLouvain), Randy Bush (Internet Initiative Japan & Arrcus, Inc), Laurent Vanbever (ETH Zürich) and Olivier Bonaventure (UCLouvain) was selected with five other articles. It will be presented by Thomas Wirtgen at a forthcoming IETF meeting.
