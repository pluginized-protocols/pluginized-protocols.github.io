The source code for the current TCPLS prototype is available on github. This prototype is a fork of the [picotls](https://github.com/h2o/picotls) implementation :

In addition to the TCPLS prototype, we are also developing a library that will allow existing applications to use TCPLS without any modification.

 - [https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/tcplslibconvert](https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/tcplslibconvert)

This library is currently a work in progress, but suggestions, comments and ideas are more than welcome !
