The source code for our xBGP prototype is available on github. It is divided in several repositories:

 - [https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/libxbgp](https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/libxbgp) contains the libxbgp implementation which can be included in different BGP implementations
 - [https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_bird](https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_bird) contains the changes required to support xBGP in BIRD
 - [https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_frr](https://github.com/pluginized-protocols/xbgp_frr) contains the changes required to support xBGP in FRRouting
