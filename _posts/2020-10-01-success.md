Internet protocols are an essential part of our online
experience. Over the last decades, a variety of protocols have been
proposed, implemented and standardised within the
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org). The 
The first step to allow BGP implementations to be programmed is to
have a clear understanding of how the BGP protocol operates and how it
processes and sends messages. If we ignore the establishment of BGP
sessions and the detection of failures, all BGP implementations need
to implement the workflow described in the figure below.

In less than forty years, computer networks and the Internet in particular moved from a simple research project into being a global infrastructure upon which our society relies more and more.
Billions of devices use a variety of protocols to exchange packets and provide a wide range of services, from entertainment to mission critical services.
There are two very different types of Internet protocols: the data
plane protocols (TCP, HTTP, TLS, ...) that hosts use to exchange data
and the control plane protocols (OSPF, BGP, PIM, ...) that are only used by routers.

The specifications developed within the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org)
define the protocol messages and a state machine, or an equivalent
representation in natural language, that indicates when messages can
be sent and how to respond. These protocol specifications are not
static. Internet protocols continuously evolve to improve performance
or address new use cases.

To illustrate this evolution, it is interesting to look the evolution
of several of the most important Internet protocols. Their evolution
can be observed through different metrics. Most Internet protocol
specifications use the key words defined in
[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) to document
implementation requirements. Each of these key words in a
standards-track RFC corresponds to a precise requirement that must be
supported by implementations.

Internet specifications started to adopt the
[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) during the first decade
of 2000s. The figure below shows the evolution of the utilisation of
these key words in the standards-track documents that have been
adopted by the working groups that are responsible for three routing
protocols : BGP, PIM and OSPF and two host protocols: TLS and
HTTP. Similar results can be obtained for other succesful Internet protocols.

As an illustration, BGP was initially defined in
[RFC1771](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1771). This RFC did not
include the [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) key
words. They only appeared in
[RFC4271](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271) and the companion
documents. BGP-4 was specified in 57 pages in 1995. Today, a BGP implementation must support more than 40 standards-track
RFCs. In terms of [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) key
words, the complexity of BGP-compliant implementations has more than
doubled during the last decade. The other protocols shown in the
figure followed a similar evolution. 


The extensibility of Internet protocols is clearly one of their key requirements. Protocols address this requirements by using
extensible message formats
(e.g. [RFC5234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5324)[RFC8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259)[RFC4506](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506)). Unfortunately,
this does not guarantee that it will be possible to easily extend the
implementation. Protocol implementations are usually considered as
blackboxes that interact with :

 - the upper layer protocol using a standardised or proprietary API
 - the lower layer protocol using its own API
 - the management protocols such as SNMP by exposing a MIB
 - other implementations of the same protocol by exchanging messages

These interactions are illustrated in the figure below.

Unfortunately, none of these interfaces take extensibility into
account. To address the extensibility of Internet protocols in a
generic manner, we propose to `pluginize` existing and future Internet
protocols. `Pluginizing` means that we propose to define a
standardised API that is exposed by all compliant implementations of a
protocol. Thanks to this API, it will be possible to extend the
features supported by an implementation using executable code, that we
refer to as plugins, supplied by the user or the upper layer protocol.
This is illustrated in the figure below assuming that the plugins are
executed by an eBPF virtual machine.

We have already demonstrated the feasibility of executing eBPF plugins
inside implementations of the QUIC, BGP and OSPF protocols in the
following conference papers:

  Olivier Bonaventure. [The Case for Pluginized Routing Protocols](https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/publications/case-pluginized-routing-protocols.html). 2019

Future blog posts will explain how we generalise the approach.
