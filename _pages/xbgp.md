BGP is one of the most important Internet routing protocols. In addition to its role to disseminate interdomain routes, BGP is also used inside ISP networks to support various value-added services including Virtual Private Networks. Large cloud provides have also started to use BGP as an intradomain routing protocol in large datacenters.

BGP was designed more than thirty years ago and has been regularly updated. However, given the importance of this routing protocol, any extension is heavily discussed within the IETF.
